            "While a lot of focus is given to politics at a national level, local-level politics often flies under the radar. Voter turnout in local elections hovers around 20% which compared to 2016‚Äôs presidential election turnout of 58%, is considerably low. There creates an issue where citizens are dissatisfied with politics and the outcomes, and yet do not engage with the level of government that most directly affects them.",
            "Part of this problem can be traced to the difficulty of accessing the deliberation process before the decisions are made. For instance, town halls, popular forums for voicing concerns to city council members, are typically held on weekdays in the middle of the day, making it difficult for students or working individuals to attend.",
            "Our solution to this was to create an online platform, an accessible mode of communication where users could directly engage in civic debate without being constrained by time or a physical location.",
            "This, however, created it‚Äôs own set of challenges. There is a lot of benefit to face-to-face interactions. Being able to detect tone, read body language, and deliberate in real time gives invaluable context and creates momentum that can result in a constructive debate. While online forms of communication are more accessible, they eliminate these context clues and create asynchronicity problems that can curb or stop the flow of dialogue. There‚Äôs a challenge to balancing these tradeoffs while trying to gain more benefits than costs."

            "One observation is that having knowledge of programming and design allowed me to bridge the gap and design wireframes that could both solve UX problems and be quickly and reliably implemented given the structure of the system. This turned out to be valuable, because we were working on three-week cycles from lo-fi wireframes to first builds for most of production.",
            "Another observation is that an important component of system design is understanding the skillset of your team and the problem at hand. We slightly over-engineered our site, using a complex tech stack that takes a non-trivial amount of time to learn. This led to lengthy onboarding times down the road, especially as the release date neared.",
            "This feeds into the next observation, that onboarding new members is surprisingly expensive. Already for design, it takes time to introduce new members to an existing system and existing workflow, and for development there is an additional configuration and initialization step in the process, which for our team took about a day on average."

Taking that knowledge, we observed several interviewees as they shopped clothes (either online or in person), and discovered that a vital step in the shopping process is asking others for critiques. We noticed that staff at some stores tended to make comments in an effort to convince the individual to buy more clothes. Friends were not dependable, there were some that offered useful advice, there were some that gave soft feedback to avoid hurting feelings, and there were some that had a different sense of fashion taste as the interviewee. Additionally, interviewees were reluctant to ask strangers because of various social pressures.",
