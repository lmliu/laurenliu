For the 2017 cycle, it challenged local citizens and designers to prototype solutions for problems centered in four mobility-based categories (walking/biking, accessibility, commuter experience, and autonomous vehicles) using a provided human-centered design process. The site itself provides information and resources for each challenge, as well as serves as a launchpad into the process for contestants.",

Being able to detect tone, read body language, and deliberate in real time gives invaluable context and creates momentum that can result in a constructive debate. While online forms of communication are more accessible, they eliminate these context clues and create asynchronicity problems that can curb or stop the flow of dialogue.

            "One observation is that having knowledge of programming and design allowed me to bridge the gap and design wireframes that could both solve UX problems and be quickly and reliably implemented given the structure of the system. This turned out to be valuable, because we were working on three-week cycles from lo-fi wireframes to first builds for most of production.",
            "Another observation is that <span class=\"det-highlights\">an important component of system design is understanding the skill set of your team and the problem at hand</span>. We over-engineered our site, using a complex tech stack that takes a non-trivial amount of time to learn, and provided features and benefits that we did not end up needing. This led to lengthy onboarding times down the road, especially as the release date neared.",
            "This feeds into the next observation, that <span class=\"det-highlights\">onboarding new members has a lead time cost</span>. It takes time to introduce new members to an existing system and existing workflow.

            "Finally, <span class=\"det-highlights\">within complex projects that have fast turnarounds, prioritization of objectives is highly important</span>. We often had issues that would have been nice to fix, but not feature-breaking and time consuming to implement. In the face on an impending deadline and the existence of other feature-breaking bugs, being able to rank the issues in terms of impact and implementation time helped us make the most effective fixes given the constraints."

Taking that knowledge, we observed several interviewees as they shopped for clothes (either online or in person), and discovered that a vital step in the shopping process is asking others for critiques. We noticed that staff at some stores tended to make comments in an effort to convince the individual to buy more clothes.
