Taking that knowledge, we observed several interviewees as they shopped clothes (either online or in person), and discovered that a vital step in the shopping process is asking others for critiques. We noticed that staff at some stores tended to make comments in an effort to convince the individual to buy more clothes. Friends were not dependable, there were some that offered useful advice, there were some that gave soft feedback to avoid hurting feelings, and there were some that had a different sense of fashion taste as the interviewee. Additionally, interviewees were reluctant to ask strangers because of various social pressures.",
